# arm-dev-study
some c code example for various arm chips
The purpose of this repo is to track progress of learning how arm chips from the beginning.  An additional goal is to understand the GNU compiler collection (GCC) and ARM CMSIS+vendor HALs. The goal is to start from as minimum code as possible and build up to using a number of on-chip peripherals while incorporating CMSIS and vendor HAL files.

The long term goal is the be able to run arbitrary, bare metal code on a Cortex-A chip. Due to the full documentation being available for the Texas Instruments am3558 processor, the BeagleBone Black will be used to break down U-Boot and maybe the Linux Kernel one day.
